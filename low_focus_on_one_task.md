## Conflict and low focus on one task 

i face a problem where everyone sends me something they need from the backend and I go to do it with left what i have now and go on with it this make me so distracted not work and foucs on one task which make it low focus on it 

- I have my backlog and it has a priority
- I'm not moving to any task until I finish what I have right now
- I put the new task in my backlog and put a priority on it
