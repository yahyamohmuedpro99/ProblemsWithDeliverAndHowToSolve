## Flow Testing
I face a problem that every time I change a small thing in the backend, I need to check the full flow to ensure it doesnâ€™t break anything here or there, 
and I need to check that everything works right. Here, I will list all solutions I will try one by one and say which ones work and in what cases they work for me

### First basic and working right now 
- write down the user story
- divide the user story into endpoints that do 1,2,3... 
- write the endpoint body and response before code the endpoint
- check the criteria and that it do the right behviour
