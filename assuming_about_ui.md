## Assuming about UI
i face a problem that sometimes while i'm test i just get the id from db ( for faster instead of go each step ðŸ˜‚ ) but this create really bad problem which is i miss some data flow like is this data i bring i send it in any endpoint already ? 
so 
- don't go to db before wait a min and ask yourself i could get this data from endpoint and go and check everything before deep dive
